# About Me
*TLDR: I'm pretty good at context-agnostic Signal Processing and data-driven engineering.*

I am a graduate student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Boston University, interning at Intuitive Surgical, in the division of the Advanced Imaging and Intelligence for Summer 2024. My academic background, expertise, and interests are primarily centered around the domains of Applied Signal Processing and AI.

In addition, I have gained valuable experience and proficiency in the fields of Computer Vision, Computational Imaging, Autonomous Driving and High-Performance-Computing Programming. I firmly believe that the successful research and development of projects necessitates a deep understanding of a core domain, complemented by a working knowledge of related domains. Thus my project selection approach is rooted in fundamental principles rather than being constrained by specific domains.

## Research Interests
Due to my interest in applied signal processing, most of my projects lies in Signal & Image Processing, Computer Vision, Robotic Perception, Machine & Deep Learning. 

### Key Expertise:
- Domains: Signal Processing: Audio, Speech and Image, Computational Imaging, Machine Learning, Machine Vision, Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning.
- Tools: Matlab, Matlab Executable CUDA(MexCuda), Numpy, SciPy, PyTorch, CUDA, CuBLAS, Nvidia Performance Primitives (NPP).
- Programming Languages: C, C++, CUDA, Python, Matlab, and Bash

### Miscellaneous
I'm writing a book! It introduces engineers to integrating MATLAB with CUDA backends to develop low-latency pipelines, an approach commonly used in various R&D environments. Its under construction but if you're impatient and don't mind half-cooked content, you can check it out here: [An Introduction to Matlab x CUDA](https://vrsreeganesh.github.io/MatlabxCUDA/intro.html#)
